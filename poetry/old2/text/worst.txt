I can still remember when
I was just a kid
Went to kindergarden in my home town
Didn't care of what I did
One time we drew funky sketches
Of some grass beneath the sun
Someone's painting had to be worst
It was always mine to be that one

Then in school we did some homework
I always had some work undone
Tried my hardest for my parents
To become the perfect son
All the teachers gave us grades
Ranging from A to E
Someone had to have the worst grades
I guess it was always me

Now I work at the local factory
Working 6 to 6 everyday
The salary is not that very fair
But I took it anyway
But the business is falling
And they needed to kick one employee
They decided to kick the worst of us
It just happens to be me

Why me, you might then ask
But who else should it be
There's always one to be worst
So it might as well be me

What should I do to continue this life
I have lost all hope in living happily
And depression has started taking over
I have lost all hope of finding family
I've begun to visit a psychiatrist
She really tries to keep me alive
And she told me as we met
If you just do your best you'll survive

But I know deep inside
I have known since I was cursed
That no matter how i try
I will always be the worst
