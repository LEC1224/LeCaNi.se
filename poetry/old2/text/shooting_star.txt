Lying still, watching the sky above
Sparkling with a million silver tears
Lying still, observing the abyss
The dots of light from a million years

For but a second, I leave this world
No wars, no borders, no hunger or fight
And I stand elevated on a single Earth
For but a second, a streak of light

A sudden movement catches my eyes
A bright visitor from long a far
In but a second, has caught my soul
The blinding light of a shooting star

By the foot of Orion, a stone is lit
Fallen giant from the days of old
And in nothing but a second
A story of a million years unfold

For long it must have traveled
Through the endless empty void
Imagine all the places it's been
All the orbits it have enjoyed

In the asteroid belt beyond Neptune
And in the oceans of Saturn's moons
In the silence of the vacuum dark
Or hidden in Tatooine's dunes

It might have been to Jupiter
Or in the dust storms of Mars
It might have been anyway
On its journey among the stars

I wonder what the Earth is like
From the rock's point of view
A pale blue dot in a sea of stars
Nothing special, I would assume

It carries so many memories
From so many places, far and near
Only to in but a second
Be burned in our atmosphere

It died here on our world
Like so many have done before
In a universe as big as this one
What is our world really for

A pale blue dot in a sea of stars
Filled with grief and anger and hate
We keep on drawing the same lines
And make believe our deeds are great

On the soil of some painted country
Lying still, in the dead of night
For but a second, in a higher place
Revealed by a streak of light

Burnt in our atmosphere
You made me see what we are
By the foot of Orion, now you can rest 
Thanks for the second, Shooting Star.
