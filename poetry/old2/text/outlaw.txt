[Verse]
Out on the plains
Driven far away from town
Out on the plains
Ridin' until the sun is down
I think it's time to turn around
And pay for my mistakes
Go back to where I'm bound
And give whatever it takes

[Bridge]
'Cus I know they'll find me soon
And I know I'm dead by noon

[Chorus]
It's the life you live
When you're livin' as an outlaw
It's your life you give
When they find you as an outlaw
What's the life you live
When you're fighting an inside war
It's the life you live
When you're livin' as an outlaw

[Verse]
A man for a man
There's no point in denying
I am a man
There's no point even trying
I might be a felon but I can't break
The holy law of give and take
Before I leave I'll stay a while
Just drink a beer and say goodbye

[Bridge]
'Cus I know they'll find me soon
And I know I'm dead by noon

[Chorus]
It's the life you live
When you're livin' as an outlaw
It's your life you give
When they find you as an outlaw
What's the life you live
When you're fighting an inside war
It's the life you live
When you're livin' as an outlaw

[Stick]
I ain't goin' to paradise
I was born and have lived in sin
Why should I not pay the price
I have lost too much to win

[Chorus]
It's the life you live
When you're livin' as an outlaw
It's your life you give
When they find you as an outlaw
What's the life you live
When you're fighting an inside war
It's the life you live
When you're livin' as an outlaw
