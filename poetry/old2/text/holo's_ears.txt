Melodi: Dream Theater - Hollow Years

It's just the kind of tale
You hear about
Years of aridity
People deep in doubt
She came there like a sign
And so she gave her word
To be a god of Pasloe

Carry us through the hard times
Bless our barren lands
Bless us with plenty water
And make our wheat grow grand

Once the drought
Makes life go under
Remember the days of older
Once the cloud that's raining
Over your fields disappears
You're taken by fear
Sing a prayer heard by Holo's ears

She's not the kind of girl
You hear about
She'll never ask for thank yous
She'll never leave her vow
She gave you all her life
She gave her everything
And still you turn and walk away

Carry me in your wagon
Bury me in your furs
Walk me across the border
And take me to northern lands

Once the folks
You're watching over
Believe they have grown older
Once the crowd is blaming
And all of your friends disappear
Alone left in fear
See the lowering down of Holo's ears.

Carry me to the north light
Give up on your merchant plans
Walk me to Yoitzus borders
And maybe you'll gain my hand

Once the town
You've been watching over
Remembers your kindness no more
Once the god you're blaming
Breaks her vow and disappears
With ale she will cheer
To the end of all those hollow years
