Three travelers in Isonia are traveling along
It’s hard to bare a cross of pain while trying to look strong
In the eastern rim of Eastwood, camping by the lake
It’s time for the hardest decision one could make

Some time ago two lovers were leaving Amberbay
Sentenced to death by King Eros, they had to run away
No sleep, a week of running from their fate
No sleep, a week of running from the hate

Three tavelers in Isonia, a baby had been born
Usually seen as a gift from gods but now a thorn
Without food, without a home, how will my child survive
I know it’s hard to let him go, but he won’t stay alive

In the eastern rim of Eastwood, camping by the lake
It’s time for the hardest decision one could make
We’ll put him down, walk away and leave him here
Tomorrow we’ll be losing someone dear

Three travelers in Isonia, soon losing someone dear
She bows down to her baby and whispers in his ear
I'm sorry, you will stay here, son, and I'm the one to blame
Then lowering her voice still more, she gives the boy a name

She hugged her child and tried to hide, the first time since they met
Outside he smiled, inside he cried, his tears full of regret
That day they lost someone dear, and now their child is gone
Two travelers in Isonia are moving on
