Melodi: Idina Menzel - Let It Go

The moon glows white in the heavens tonight
Not a cloud is to be seen
Our kingdom in isolation
And the virus reigns supreme
The world is counting on its folks to stay inside
I can't have this LAN, when corona thrives

Don't let them in, just let it be
Be the good boy, protect society
Don't meet, don't greet, what can I do?
Well now I know!

Livestream show! Livestream show!
The LAN will be no more
Livestream show! Livestream show!
Stay away and close the door!

I'm not scared
Of no virus or plague
I'm an introvert
Being alone never bothered me anyway

We will have to keep our distance
But that won't make us fall
And as it turns out with birthdays
Seems I can't count at all

I'd never know how bad I'd do
How could that second fail slip though
First right, then wrong how can it be?
Fuck me!

Livestream show! Livestream show!
Our server is turning five
Livestream show! Livestream show!
I'm just 'bout to go live!

On twitch I am
And on twitch I'll stay
Will you come and join?

My brother furries see the moon and make a sound
My soul is wolven and I howl just like a demon hound
Hear the call of MÃ¥negarm echo far, wide and vast
I'm never going back
The human's in the past!

Livestream show! Livestream show!
We'll game 'til the break of dawn
Livestream show! Livestream show!
Now let's kick start this WAN

Here I am
And it's time to play
Let the stream turn on
Being alone never bothered me anyway!
