Melodi: World's hardest Karaoke Song

This is the a-ö of Sweden,
so try to sing along. 
This is the a-ö of Sweden,
There's so much that could go wrong? 

I start my day with coffee or fika is what we say
I pour a little mjölk in and bullar on the tray
I look out the window to see if there is sol
I eat my Smörgåstårta and sit down in my stol.
This land is kind of awesome
no matter what you see,
There’s åkrar, berg, and skogar
And vänner you can meet.
Skål

So pack your väskor
Sweden has it all.
From öster to väster
Just don’t look for Swiss.
We're not the same counrty!

This is the a-ö of Sweden,
so try to sing along. 
This is the a-ö of Sweden,
There's so much that could go wrong? 

Göteborg is cosy
Come besök on your stay
But don’t forget that Stockholm
And Skåne is okay.
You might see havrefält
Or hike in the lövskog
And don't greet any främling
Because that is not good?
Ursäkta!

And you can take the Svenska Järnvägs tåg
Enjoy the ride to Norrlandsbotten
On our fjäll, you can take a walk
And you can trampa on the moss
It grows back so slow!
But we're not as picky about it as Islänningarna

This is the a-ö of Sweden,
so try to sing along. 
This is the a-ö of Sweden,
There's so much that could go wrong? 

Since the tidsbegynnelse
The Älg has been around.
Stor som fan and gracious
Every driver's worst friend
We drive on natt and krockar
'Cus germans steal the skylt
We hunt them with a bössa
And then eat them with some
Sylt!

This is the a-ö of Sweden,
so try to sing along. 
This is the a-ö of Sweden,
There's so much that could go wrong? 
This is the a-ö of Sverige,
so försök att sjunga med
This is the a-ö of Sverige,
Now memories this låt!

You just sang the second hardest karaoke song in the world, you speak Svenska. 
You can even say Algrens bilar
You’re almost an Swede, almost, seriously it’s not much paperwork, we already have thousands of illegal immigrants.
Just move here.
