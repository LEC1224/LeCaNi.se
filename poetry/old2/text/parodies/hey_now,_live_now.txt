Melodi: Smash Mouth - Allstar

Somebody once told me
Go live life like you own it
Don't spend a single day in your bed
So I try to live it fun
Since the day that it begun
Until the day when I am dead

Well, the years are coming
But they aren't returning
Gotta be me
Gotta keep my soul burning
It doesn't make sense not to live for fun
When it comes to lives you only have one
So much to do, so much to see
So don't stay hiding in the backstreets
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never live other than now

Hey Now
You're in my car, put the cams on
Break through
Live Now
Have a great time, you're in the Live
Now Crew
And all that matters is now
Only idiots live by their doubts

Earth's a big place
And you can go so far
But no need to travel if there's beauty where you are
Try to be yourself even if you differ
Let haters judge if you don't fit the picture
The snow we ski is getting pretty thin
The water’s getting warm and cliff jumping’s a thing
The world's on fire, and full of war
If we all could live now that would be no more

Hey Now
You're in my car, put the cams on
Be true
Live Now
Have a great time, you're in the Live
Now Crew
And all that matters is now
Only idiots live by their doubts

Hey Now
You're in my car, get the cams on
Be you
Live Now
Have a great time, you're in the Live
Now Crew
And all that matters is now
Only idiots

Somebody once asked
Why the fuck would you do that
It is dangerous and you could fall
I said yep. That is correct. I'd rather die small
than not to live at all
And I would never let my life be a waste

Well the years are coming
And we stop for nothing
Break all the rules and just keep on running
It doesn't make sense not to live for fun
When it comes to lives you’re only blessed one
So much to do, so much to see
So don't stay hiding in the backstreets
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never live other than now

Hey Now
You're in my car, get the cams on
Break through
Live Now
Have a great time, you're in the Live
Now Crew
And all that matters is now
Only idiots live by their doubts
