Melodi: KISS - Heaven's on Fire

He’s holding B and his blood boils hot
I feel the temperature rise
He’s like a wall, givin’ all he got
There’s hunger in his eyes
They’re pushing closer to the AWP
You’ve never met anyone half as skilled
Kevlar won’t protect you when you’re facing HillD

Feel defeat takin' new heights
burn the Ts, HillD is on fire
Faintest try will expire
Bullets fly, HillD is on fire

He’s got the Deagle and a Redline AWP
Left in a clutch you can’t make
HillD just won’t stop
Smoke plays on top, clutch it like a piece of cake
He’s pushing closer with the AWP
Around the corner and he takes the peek
You can’t tame the devil on our team

Feel defeat takin' new heights
burn CTs, HillD is on fire
Faintest try will expire
Bullets fly, HillD is on fire

Oho HillD is on fire, oho HillD is on fire, oho

We’re out of money, out of skill and luck
Nothing’s in our favor and we’re kinda stuck
HillD comes saving in a Firetruck

Feel the heat, takin' your life
MVP, HillD is on fire
Make them cry, win denied
 
Feel the heat, takin' your life
MVP, HillD is on fire
Make them cry, win denied
He’s too fly, HillD is on fire

Feel the heat, takin' your life
MVP, HillD is on fire
Make them cry, win denied
He’s too fly, HillD is on fire
