A crying silhouette in a chair
Scattered bottles everywhere
All just as empty as the bed
A crying silhouette left for dead
A million stories left untold
And every future looks dark and cold
How to break out is yet unknown
But it cannot be done on your own

You’re scared that the darkness will give you scars
But you need the darkness to see the stars
It might be hard trembling in the dark
But when morning arrives you will embrace the mark

An open door with a knob of chrome
A broken chair in a broken home
A silhouette astray in the night
Gazing hopeless into headlights
A young adult driving down the town
Wheels rolling fast above the ground
Out of nowhere pulling the brakes
Trying to stop with all it takes

You’re scared that the darkness will give you scars
But you need the darkness to see the stars
It might be hard trembling in the dark
But when morning arrives you will embrace the mark

All she's been through, it's hard to cope
But she used bad memories to build hope
A million stories left untold
But with every new step new paths unfold
A buckled car parked by the sunset
Two figures forming a silhouette
Gazing hopefully eye to eye
Soon the stars will fill the sky
