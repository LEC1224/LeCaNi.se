Who says spiritual life is for believers only
Who says you can't feel blessed if you give up the holy
Who ever it was, he had a crazy notion
Let me enlighten you with evolution

Four billion years of natural selection
Four billion years requiring perfection
Every generation is forced to succeed
To live long enough to pass on their seed
It’s hell of a task as the millions go on
A single failure and your bloodline is gone
Think about it. Every mom, every dad
Since the rise of the cell, every parent you've had
Had only one failed, you would have too
A billion successes all led to you

To be honest, what would you rather be
A billion successes or some poor man's hobby
Just because the world has no magic
Doesn't mean it's not magical
And with all the death and tragic
I find God to not be that good after all
But if my story about evolution didn't enlight you
Let me tell of the cosmos that lives inside you

First there was nothing, then big bang took place
Suddenly from nothing there was time and space
Hydrogen atoms were all that there was
Everything else is just here because
Stars were born and deep in their core
Hydrogen fused into helium and more
Every element you’ll ever know of
Was made in a star that went supernova
So if you have ever wondered what you are
Your every atom was made in a star
And when you look up to the stars in the night
You’re one of them and you’re just as bright

Ten gods or none, I really don't care
Heaven is real and we're already there
