[VERSE 1]
Just a normal man
I have a normal life
I'm nothing more than that
What's wrong with being right
Am I not alone
Is it not safe to stay
Am I shadowed by someone
Should I try to run away

[CHORUS]
Let me out of this game
Set my spirit free
Must I go insane
To be what I must be
I am not alone
I can tell from what I hear
This is not my home
Am I locked behind my fear

[VERSE 2]
I know what I heard from him
I know what I saw
Am I wrong for telling the truth
Am I breaking any law
What's this all about
Can you hear me screaming
Is there a way out
Am I only dreaming

[CHORUS]
Let me out of this game
Set my spirit free
Must I go insane
To be what I must be
I am not alone
I can tell from what I hear
This is not my home
Am I locked behind my fear

[VERSE 3]
Am I what I'm meant to be
Or am I something else
Am I not the man I see
When I look upon myself
Is it true the things they say
Is my brain playing my heart
Is it not safe to stay
Should I let them go apart

[ALTERED CHORUS]
Let me out of his game
Set my spirit free
Have I gone insane
All the things that I see
Am I not alone
Is it me, the things I hear
This is not my home
I am locked behind my fear

[VERSE 4]
I will not play his game
I will not yield
Breaking out of the frame
Into the open field
Finally know what I am
Leave a world not meant for me
With a gun in my hand
Let my spirit free
