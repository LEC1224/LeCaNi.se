Today, it's easy to look back at the Roman Empire, the Inca Empire, and ancient Egypt as old, obviously extinct civilizations. But if you had lived during their prime, wouldn't you have believed they were eternal? That the next hundred years would be just like the previous thousand? Yet there seems to be something that ultimately ends all civilizations. It's reminiscent of the Fermi Paradox. Shouldn't space be teeming with life in every solar system across the galaxy? Where is everyone? Did they all perish before they could traverse the stars? How? Why?

Today, all of Earth's civilizations are so interconnected that they can be viewed as one. And with that comes a daunting realization: the next time a civilization falls, we all fall with it.

It could be a natural catastrophe, like the mass extinctions of the past. It could also be something of our own doing. We've historically been poor at avoiding the creation of our own monsters. In 1945, we birthed a devil, and shortly after, we grasped the implications of nuclear winter. Yet, we continued to develop even larger bombs and still have thousands in stock today. Everyone knows our planet cannot withstand the strains we're placing on it, but does that stop us from extracting oil, burning coal, or driving cars?

Yet we call ourselves "intelligent life". I might not choose that label. But we are "conscious life". Isn't that far more astonishing than mere intelligence? We are the beings who experience the universe. We love, marvel at the night sky, and witness the beauty of galaxies, nebulae, and alien worlds. We create beauty through poetry, mathematics, and art.

We are not just a part of the universe; we give the universe its purpose.

We've come so far. We're incredibly capable, thanks to the technology developed over countless generations. We carry a remarkable legacy from those who came before us. And the pace is only quickening.

It seems highly probable that within my lifetime, I will witness the next pivotal moment in this long tradition of rising and falling civilizations. On one hand, we could be the last civilization to fall, taking with us perhaps the universe's only consciousness. On the other, we could be the first civilization to achieve immortality.

It's not beyond our reach to use our technological heritage to heal our planet and once again live in harmony with nature. And not far away lies Mars. Colonizing another planet will be a brutal endeavor, involving suffering, death, and massive resources. But we have the technology for it, and once there, we overcome one of the Great Filter's largest hurdles. No longer at the mercy of nuclear winter, pandemics, or massive meteorites.

How many planets out there once housed conscious beings who loved, hated, and then vanished, leaving behind barren desert worlds with barely noticeable traces of the once-magnificent cities? Like the ruins of Machu Picchu of the Incas, the pyramids of Egypt, or the Colosseum of Rome. Decaying reminders of past civilizations believed to be eternal?

We are the first with the potential to live forever. So, with a sly smile, I extend my hand and ask: Shall we?
