[Verse 1]
Long ago in the southern lands
A beautiful girl shook a farmers hand
A promise held her to wheat fields bound
With her skill seeds grew in barren ground
Through the years, sometimes wheat would fall
She gave her best but couldn't do it all
So hopeful once but with time she learned
When the village people started to blame her

[Bridge]
It's just fake, it's a tale they told
It's not real, she's a ghost of old
She can say what she wants
The wind's still cold
But her heart will always
Be made of gold

[Chorus]
She will keep to her vow
All the time
Even when they won't understand
She will not turn on their backs
She's all too kind
She'll lend her folks a helping hand
She'll always lend a helping hand

[Verse 2]
When man believed he had grown up
The thank yous vanished and prayers stopped
Times are not as they once were
All she has left is her silk brown fur
Seasons changing had turned to pain
But through all the years she would still remain
To find a person with that faith is odd
A skill worthy only of a god

[Bridge]
It's just fake, it's a tale they told
It's not real, she's a ghost of old
She can say what she wants
The wind's still cold
But her heart will always
Remain of gold

[Chorus]
She will keep to her vow
All the time
Even when they won't understand
She will not turn on their backs
She's all too kind
She'll lend her folks a helping hand
She'll always lend a helping hand

[Mini Verse 1]
Hundred years since the last stopped to believe
A wagon rolled by and she took her leave
"Take me to the forests beneath the northern light
And I'll make it worth to you ever since this night"

[Break/Bridge]
Ties of iron made
Eight lifetimes sold
Though iron will fade
So will never gold

[Chorus]
She will keep to her vow
All the time
Even if he won't understand
She will not turn on his back
She's all too kind
She'll lend her man a helping hand
She'll always lend a helping hand

[Mini Verse 2]
Through all the years she had come to learn
The trust of humans is hard to earn
But this trader might happen to hold
Another heart, his too made of gold

[Bridge]
It's not just fake, the tales they told
It's all too real, the hand I hold
They can go where they want
Their path unfolds
And their hearts will always
Remain of gold

[Chorus]
He will keep to the vow
All the time
He'll take her to the northern lands
She will not turn on his back
She's all too kind
Together they walk hand in hand
Through hard times they walk hand in hand
They walk hand in hand
