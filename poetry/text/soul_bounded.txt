Skrevs till melodin "Survivor - Desperate Dreams"

Two places
Buildings so similar
Who could believe they're worlds apart
Two faces
Features so similar
Same rhythm beats within their hearts
Souls entwined
Yet still very different
How can they find their common space
In their minds
Bridge over distance
Leading them Home to the same place

Two hearts
Pumping the same blood
Two pots
Spun by the same mud
Two boys
Soul bounded brothers
One life
Shared with each other

One life style
Between their differences
Worth more than any weight of gold
One life time
A million experiences
Who knows what their future will hold
One promise
Chasing good memories
To tell when they both are old
United
Shoulder to shoulder
Ready to see their lives unfold

Two hearts
Pumping the same blood
Two pots
Spun by the same mud
Two boys
Soul bounded brothers
One life
Shared with each other

Though minds divide them
A bond unite them
Two halves are shining
Full moon shines brighter
