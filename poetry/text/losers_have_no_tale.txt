You fought so hard
In a war so cold
But your part
Was never told
You did all you could
A life for the greater good

You lost the war
As an enemy
And what for
No memory
Goodness will prevail
For the losers have no tale

You're lost to time
You're no hero
And your crime
Is all we know
You gave your life and heart
But we'll never hear you tell that part

The good side
Will aways win
And hide
Their part of sin
Cherry pick the truth
When they tell it to their youth

And then in a blink
The youth mature
And we think
We found the cure
And goodness will prevail
For the losers have no tale
