Melodi: Journey - Faithfully

A-site run
Holding my loaded gun
Afraid to fuck it up
You're on my mind
To play my part
Hold your side tonight
Sending all the Ts
To the fire

They say that the site is no place for a simple MGE
How could I put up against the T
And playing with a noob like me ain't always what it's supposed to be
Oh, man, you stand by me
I'm forever yours
Jacobsqy

On mirage
Caught with a nade in hand
Sprayed down to the ground
Now I'm dead
Though you stand tall
Fighting against them all
Waiting for support
I have betrayed you

And being this bad ain't helping to protect my friend
Respawn the next round and I will try again
I get the joy of retrying covering you
Oh, man, you stand by me
I'm forever yours
Jacobsqy

Double T
I'm still yours
I'm forever yours
On mirage
