It's so overwhelming
Getting harder to cope
Is this my calendar
Or kaleidoscope
With ten thousand missions
Waiting right by the door
And an urge to complete them
And then ten thousand more

I will stress through it all
Like I'm always too late
It's a curse for the weaker
But to me it's my fate
I will keep going strong
Twice the distance where you quitted
No rest
No rest for the wicked

I feel way too tired
Want to stay in my bed
This ordeal can't be healthy
But I'll sleep when I'm dead
You don't need a second life
In Heaven or Hell
If you know how to spend it
One is perfectly well

I will stress through it all
Like I'm always too late
It's a curse for the weaker
But to me it's my fate
You deserve a day off
I was told by some dickhead
No thanks
No rest for the wicked

I will stress through it all
Like I'm always too late
It's a curse for the weaker
But to me it's my fate
I will keep going strong
Twice the distance where you quitted
No rest
No rest for the wicked
