Melodi: David Guetta - Titanium

I'm rolling out, 39A but I won't stay
I'm taking off, in smoke and dust
Merlin 1D, raising up my apogee
Shaking sound as I go up

I'm future proof, no parts to lose
Fly again, fly again
Legs deployed, I take my aim
Fly again, fly again

I'm coming down, but I won't fall
Grids of titanium
Before the ground, come to a stall
Grids of titanium

Breaking ground, combine three cores and light them all
Thrice the thrust and heavy loads
Raise the stakes, twice the cargo, half the cost
ULA not saying much

I'm future proof, no parts to lose
Fly again, fly again
Legs deployed, we take our aim
Fly again, fly again

I'm coming down, but I won't fall
Grids of titanium
Before the ground, come to a stall
Grids of titanium
Grids of titanium
Grids of titanium

Block Five, Falcon Nine
Face reentry, still survive
Stone hard, as bulletproof glass
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium

Impossible, I'll change it all
I'm unobtainium
SpaceX rise while others fall
I'm unobtainium
