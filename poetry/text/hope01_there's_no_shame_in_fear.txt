Once upon a time
Not so different from our own
A low born family
In the edge of Riverstone
The god of rain once said
I’m longing for your head
But Enethye was strong
He stood up and sang his song

You can take my water from me
My farm will still survive
I know there’s still hope for me
As long as I’m alive
As long as I have family
I’ll laugh and love and cheer
I’m scared of you in agony
But there’s no shame in fear

Anette stood by her man
As so many years before
When snow covered the land
They simply closed the door
In the middle of a night
Anethe was struck by light
She pushed and saw her child
A new life young and wild

He might have taken water
But couldn’t take my wife
Now I have a daughter
And now there’s hope for life
That night felt like a stranger
I cried a happy tear
I know my child face danger
But there’s no shame in fear
