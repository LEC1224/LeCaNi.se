Look up one starlit beautiful night, and take in the light from every star
At first glance, they might seem unreachable from where you are
You might feel insignificantly small
But I don't think that’s true at all

Raise your gaze once again
And look closer, and even closer then
There's an ocean out there
For all of us to explore
We don't have to go anywhere
But isn't that what oceans are for?
It might not go as we plan
And surely, some things will probably fail
But there's a future on the horizon
And I think it's time to set sail

We will go where no one has gone before
It is once again time for the human race to explore
To Columbus, Armstrong and all who paved our way
Not because it is easy, but because it’s in our DNA
Look again, towards those shiny stars
See that red one over there? That’s Mars.
It will be our first destination
In this new era of human exploration
But not nearly the last, I might enlighten
When we then set sail for Saturn’s moon Titan
And then for every other habitable place
In all of the galaxy, and all of space

Am I sounding too ambitious, might I ask
Am I describing an impossible task
I might have to remind you, you know
There once was a generation, not so long ago
That was born into a world where airplanes didn't fly
But in a world with footprints on the moon, they died
Let me repeat because this is truly absurd
It took only 60 years from leaving ground to walking on another world

Will our generation see the same astonishing feats?
Will we live in a world where only the best of history repeats?
I say yes, and this time at an even more insane rate
Because you know what, innovation hasn't precisely ceased to accelerate
They went to the moon with a computer as complex as your watch for fuck sake
Try to put that up against Intel Comet Lake
We should do the things they thought of only imagination
Because that is the mission of our generation
We might not have created the universe
And we don't yet cast lightning rods
But in every other sensible way
With our technology and knowledge, we are gods.
So, with this in mind, what do you say,
Should we dream of tomorrow or yesterday?
