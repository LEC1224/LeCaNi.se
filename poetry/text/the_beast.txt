Melodi: Ghost - He Is

He's buying SSG - Abyss
And his fur is in flames
Two try hard bad guys falling down
To the beast who can't be tamed

He is
He's the tiger and he bites
From the jungle in the east
And he is
To perfection, he is wild
And we shout Release the Beast
He is
Nostro bestia, fuge ad vitam
He is

We're fighting here against the Ts
And all our doubts are now destroyed
The tiger with the weapon drawn 

He is
He's the tiger and he bites
From the jungle in the east
And he is
To perfection, he is wild
And we shall release the Beast

He is
He's the tiger and he bites
From the jungle in the east
And he is
The disobedience, that kills you when ever
He is  
Nostro bestia, fuge ad vitam 
He is
And he is fighting, so let the hunt begin
