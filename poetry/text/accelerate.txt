What about the environment?
What if AI takes over?
Watch out for Kessler Syndrome!
What about nuclear war?
Or biohazards?
We are too powerful, we must back down.

No! I won't take it!
I'm tired of worrying.
Tired of fearing.
Fuck it!
"The brave may not live forever,
but the cautious don't live at all."
I'll be brave!

Whatever takes us to the stars, be my religion.

Do I believe in God?
Yeah, I guess I do.
But our mistake was putting Him in the past.
“He, the Creator.” Fuck him.
No. God is from the future.
And He is us.
I sacrifice,
to him my time.
Our greatest ritual;
where scientists and engineers gather
to bring him a little bit closer.

We always thought the lesson of Icarus was “Don't fly too close to the sun.”
How could we be that stupid?
Clearly, it's “Build better fucking wings!”

Bring me the future.
I can't stand the wait!
We'll solve it all.
We'll be fucking great.

We'll rebuild the Tower of Babel.
We're ready.
Grab my hand, anon. Hurry up!
Kardachev is waiting.

Together, we’ll walk through the pearly gate.
Together, we'll be fucking great.
Together, we accelerate.
