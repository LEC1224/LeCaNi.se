Melodi: ABBA - Dancing Queen

Dragon dance, you can fly, you are the best queen alive
See that girl, watch that scene, she is the Dragon Queen

Fire and blood, born in Dragonstone
Coming back to reclaim the Throne
She's the rightful ruler, stopping for nothing
Daughter of The Mad King
Cersei couldn't have won the fight
Night King's dead and her chance is high
The scorpions were useless, everything was fine
Cersei is in her hands
There is a peaceful chance...

You are the Dragon Queen, young and sweet, letting slaves go free
Dragon Queen, feel the love from your Khaleesi
Dragon dance, no-one dies, rescuing ten thousand lives
See that girl, watch that scene, she is the Dragon Queen

You were supposed to be the one
But now when you know the truth about Jon
When the bells rang like music, and everything was fine
Things started to go bad
And you became your dad

You are the Dragon Queen, mad and mean, killing the freedom dream
Dragon Queen, feel the fire from your Khaleesi
Dragon dance, death desire, ruining the quest of your life
See that girl, watch that scene, she is the Dragon Queen

This is looking really bad
And you became your dad

You are the Dragon Queen, mad and mean, crushing the freedom dream
Dragon Queen, feel defeat to the Khaleesi
