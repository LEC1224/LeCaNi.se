They knew there could be no way
If they stayed silent yesterday
Seven billion asking now
Will the bird survive somehow
Not a victory when rifles cry
But they knew they couldn't hide
In the fight they're bound to die
But they didn't ask for a ride

When the bullets fly
Where the missiles strike
They're resisting the beast
Growling bear from the East
Freedom prevail
Sings the Nightingale
And takes off to the air
Resisting the bear

A world lost in oblivion
Of a time imagined gone
When the stakes are towering high
By the force of nuclei
The eagle remains at rest
Hiding quiet in his nest
That's when the Heroes of Ukraine
Face the test

When the bullets fly
Where the missiles strike
They're resisting the beast
Growling bear from the East
Freedom prevail
Sings the Nightingale
And takes off to the air
Resisting the bear

Freedom prevail
Sings the Nightingale
That's when the Heroes of Ukraine
Face the test
