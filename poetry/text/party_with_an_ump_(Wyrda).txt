Melodi: Miley Cyrus - Party in the USA

He jumped into a lobby in CS
With a dream to be carryin’
Welcome to the land of game experts
Is he gonna fit in?

Searched for a game
He’s unranked, not the first time
Can he really match with those guys
That would just be crazy
Everybody’s black (not racist)

The game is starting
And the pistol round is lost quick
Too much pressure and he’s nervous
That when we should go eco but he says no
And the UMP was on
And the UMP was on
And the UMP was on

So he puts his gun up
We’re going A long
They all just fall in one spray
He’s rushing to A like yeah
Running gunning like yeah
Next round the same stuff
Every round won
He’s gonna rank up today
Yeah, it’s a party with an UMP
Yeah, it’s a party with an UMP

Get to the top of the scoreboard fast
Everybody’s looking at me now
Like “Who’s that Silver Elite dick,
Who’s kicking my ass with scout?”

So ez when I’ve got the wyrda with me
One silver man against a whole army
‘Cause all I do is force and let go
What the frick is even eco

The game is turning
And the enemies win rounds quick
9 to 13 and I’m nervous
That’s when Granen called for a saving round
But the show just must go on
And my money’s lost since long
And the UMP goes strong

So I put my gun up
We’re going A long
They all just fall in one spray
I’m tapping their heads like yeah
Winning the round like yeah
Next round the same stuff
Every round won
I’m gonna rank up today
Yeah, it’s a party with an UMP
Yeah, it’s a party with an UMP

Feeling like taking another fight (another fight)
Take my score to another height (another height)
15-13, what a sight
One last round and I’ll be alright

So I put my gun up
We’re going A long
They all just fall in one spray
I’m tapping their heads like yeah
Winning the round like yeah
Next round the same stuff
Every round won
I’m gonna rank up today
Yeah, it’s a party with an UMP
Yeah, it’s a party with an UMP

So I put my gun up
We’re going A long
They all just fall in one spray
I’m tapping their heads like yeah
Winning the rounds like yeah
Next round the same stuff
Every round won
I’m gonna rank up today
Yeah, it’s a party with an UMP
Yeah, it’s a party with an UMP
