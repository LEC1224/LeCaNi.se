Melodi: Europe - Final Countdown

Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one

Once told by the legends
One prophecy play
The play of a decade
Can it be? Who can say?

As some1 alone has remained
He's leaving ground (leaving ground)
He's life'll never be the same again

Just when Some1 jumped down
Some1 jumped down

The clutch of a genius (genius)
When some1 stands tall
And just like a phoenix
Ascends from the  fall, yeah

With but a few seconds to go
The bomb's ticking down (ticking down)
And just as the phophecy told

So does Some1 jump down
In the final countdown

Some1 jumped down
Saved his weapon

Ooh
Hooh-oh-oh

In the final countdown
Ooh

That’s when Some1 jumped down
Some1 jumped down

In the final countdown
Some1 jumped down

Ooh
When the bomb reach countdown
He's praised in the heavens
Some1 jumped down
The legends unfold
It’s the final countdown

It's the tale of Some1
