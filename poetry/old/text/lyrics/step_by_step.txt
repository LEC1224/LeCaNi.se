Jimmy went to school in Harrenbay
And did his homework every day
He was kind to all around
Though he rarely made a sound

It was hard for him to study
And even harder to get a buddy
As the days got worse and worse
He fell deeper into his solitary curse

As the years dried out of hope
He started thinking of the rope
But his parents never let him down
And his old man helped him off the ground

He said
"Times will change and light will show up.
You'll learn to live as you grow up.
Life has more in store than you will ever know.
Take it step by step as you go."

He took his father's words by heart
And did his best in every part
He scored well and got to college
Where he further expanded his knowledge

Six years past and things went well
He past the college where he excelled
He got the dream job of his life
And met a girl who became his wife

They had twin girls, Annie and Annette
Now Jimmy had what he thought he'd never get
As the girls grew up to face the world
He passed on his father's blessing words

He said
"Times will change and light will show up.
You'll learn to live as you grow up.
Life has more in store than you will ever know.
Take it step by step as you go."

Their life was great. Their love was strong
But deep in his soul he still felt wrong
Everyone thought their smiles would last
But poor Jimmy could not forget his past

Jimmy had all he could ever need
But not enough to stop his soul bleed
It's hard to live to a happy end
When the brigde is still your only best friend

The times had changed and darkness had showed up
He had learn to die as he grew up
Through all his steps it all came to this one
A final step and then he was gone
