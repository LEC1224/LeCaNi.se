Look at that first blank page
An empty canvas to engage
Pick my pencil off the tray
Thinking what to write today
Maybe I'll write a happy song
Maybe I'll write it all day long
Maybe I'll write the saddest verse
Or even something worse

And the only thing I know for sure is
When the day is over
The entire page will be covered

Writing about the life of mine
And my pen will never sleep
‘Cause I will never skip a line
Never ever write it cheap, no
Writing of every thought I think
And every word I've said
And if I'm running out of ink
I'll only use my blood instead

All the sketches that I drew
All the chapters I've been through
Look how thick that book is now
Sometime I'll reach an end somehow
There's no reason to pretend
‘Cause it's hard to write the perfect end
When you don't know how many pages there are left
But I'm sure to do my best

And the only thing I know for sure is
When the day is done
Another page is gone

Writing about the life of mine
And my pen will never sleep
‘Cause I will never skip a line
Never ever write it cheap, no
Writing of every thought I think
And every storm ahead
And if I'm running out of ink
I'll only use my blood instead

Writing of every thought I think
And every dream I've had
And if I'm running out of ink
I'll only use my blood instead
