Today everything feels
Like the best it can be
No worries, no surrender 
No problem can reach me
Today I am an angel
But tomorrow I might fall
If you're driving really fast
You are bound to hit a wall
It's easy to be happy
When greeted with a smile
It's easy to feel peaceful
But only for a while
I try the best I can
But I know that it's in vein
Cause deep inside I know
After sunshine comes rain

Everybody tells me
After rain comes the sun
And everybody tells me
After boring times comes fun
But never do they tell me
The truth between the lines
What happens every time
When the sun stops to shine

The memories I carry
The things I've got to see
It's more than I can ask for
They're way too good for me
I know I should be thankful
And trust me, that I am
But sometimes it can feel like
My memories are a scam
Do you ever ask
Why should it be this way
Can't the sun shine forever
Why can't the sun stay
Some days we feel like heroes
But can't deny the pain
Cause everybody knows
After sunshine comes rain

Everybody tells me
After rain comes the sun
And everybody tells me
After boring times comes fun
But never do they tell me
The truth between the lines
What happens every time
When the sun stops to shine

When the sun is burning
I really feel alive
But just as it gets better
The heavy clouds arrive
Today I am an angel
And everything is fine
But rain will always follow
When the sun stops to shine
