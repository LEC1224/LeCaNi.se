Are you with me?
Are you with me in this moment of doubt?
Are you with me through this pitch-black night?
Can you see the dim light of hope in the far end of the tunnel?
I know this won't be easy.
I know this will take everything.
But I know that if we stand together, hand in hand, we can be their worst nightmare!
Are you with me?
They might have the upper hand,
They might have more rounds than we,
But damn they don't have what we have. No. They do not have this team, this passion.
So are you with me?
When I look upon you, I don't see losers
Neither do I see ordinary people.
Heck, I don't even see champions. No.
When I look upon you, I see nothing less than the divine decendents of God himself!
This won't be a walk on roses.
This won't be any hike in the midday sunshine.
No. This will be a climb.
A steep climb.
But I know the veiw from the top of the mountain is ten times better when the climb is hard.
And I say it is worth a try.
This journey will be a steep climb not suited for anyone.
But are we anyone? Are we ordinary people?
No! We are the divine decendents of God himself!
So I ask you once again!
Are you with me?
