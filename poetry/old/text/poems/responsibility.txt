Everyday on the news they say the world is a flame
All the wars, all the death, although we are to blame
Why wake up and make up a plan to fix this place
There's no point in point out that there's death we all face
We can't restart and retry, this life ain't no game
We can try to deny it but we'll still end the same
As today's just a day and just like yesterday
Earth is bound to break down and we're all to decay
